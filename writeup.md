The brief write-up

Things I know now:

I finally understood what people meant when they said that “Linux is an open-source software”. Anyone can download the source code for Linux and do whatever they want
with it. Customize it for personal use. Release their own version of Linux publicly. The fact that is possible is an exciting prospect for a CSE student such as myself.
I believe the best way to learn is to play around and make your own mistakes. This course has introduced me to and helped familiarize me with a part of computer science 
that I had never interacted with before. Working with a terminal. It’s almost as though the terminal plays the role of a linguistic translator in a conversation between
user and system. I’ve gained a deep appreciation for what is capable when one uses a terminal. I look forward to practicing and implementing the concepts that have been 
taught in this course as well as explore more on my own! I did not want to go too deep in to the technical things that I have learnt in this excellent course since this
write up was supposed to be brief. Thus, I decided to talk about a couple of topics that I found interesting. Another one of those topics is the different philosophies 
that concepts in Linux apply to as well as the discourse in the Linux community. 
Finally, as for whether Linux is better than Windows/MacOS…. I think they’re all great! They all have their strengths. As a Windows user for 10+ years now, I have grown accustomed to it. I find very few faults in it. However, I also understand how Linux if used correctly can help you expand your knowledge in development along with many other advantages. Versatility, security, a tight-knit community (which helps increase your want to immerse yourself in the subject) etc. In conclusion to this subject, I think they’re both great.
